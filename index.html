    console.log("I've always loved her since the first day I met her, I know it seems selfish of me but I can't help it. Her smile, her happiness. It makes me happy. She's the only one I loved that's not related to me. Her laugh, her voice. Seeing her happy just calms my devil 'sh soul down.  Sorry for this Harry Potter book but this is probrably the only way I can express myself without someone accidentally coming across it. You would need to look for this to find this. I can't explain how broken I am from the inside with verbal explaination, every time she texts me, I get so euphoric. I just want her to be happy even if it means I have to endure this broken heart. </3");
